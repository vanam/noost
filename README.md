# Noost

Simple bootstrapping tool for PHP web development using modern tools.

## Requirements

* [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/)

## Why is it named Noost?

Name come from words `Nette` and `boost` since it is tool primary designed for Nette framework.

## Roadmap

* Initiate project from custom composer package
* Define custom path to apache configuration file
* Multiple operating systems
* Multiple frontend projects (eg. front and admin)
* Move temporary/development files out of `www` directory because they can be accessed on production server
* Separate styles to separate git repository/module
